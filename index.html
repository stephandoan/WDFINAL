      We all have distractions in our lives, at least up to varying degrees.
      Most of us are familiar with the massive drop in attention span that
      many people have picked up over the past few years. A popular statistic
      that has been dropped occasionally is that our attention span has dropped
      to about 8 seconds on average. More specifically, <a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/human-attention-span/"> Wyzowl</a>
      says that we tend to only read around 20% of the words on a web page.
      <br><br>
      Is that what you're doing here?
      <br><br>
      Are you glancing at that dog in the corner? It's not leaving. Are you
      glancing at your phone?

      At this point, it's painfully obvious why we're more easily distracted now.
      For some of us, it started with chain or spam emails with catchy subject
      lines. Then it was followed by baited headlines and titles of writing
      that we all shared with each other. Soon, platforms like Vine and Twitter
      built their entire business models on supporting short, enticing bursts
      of content. We see Vine's model of concise video has never fallen from
      grace given Tiktok's success. We absolutely devour shortform content and
      that makes it infinitely easier for us to be derailed from important matters.
      Even in politics, it's even easier for someone to bring up a new issue
      which will eventually overtake something older but still unresolved. The
      first issue slowly fades away with only a few people trying to draw attention to it.

      Our diminishing attention spans aren't only a personal issue. They affect
      society as a whole. What the general public makes, consumes, and cares about
      becomes more easily manipulated as this goes on. How many people would
      notice if I included part of the "Bee Movie" script in this short site?

      Here, you've found the dog's cousin.

      It's hard to undo years of conditioning, but it's not worth the consequences
      of complacency.
